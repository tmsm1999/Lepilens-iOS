Lepilens aims to connect its users with nature and butterflies, and help citizen science efforts in mapping biodiversity. Butterflies play an essential role in the natural ecosystem as pollinators and as food for other animals in all stages of their life cycle. Their intricate relationships with plants and animals means that they are often the first to be endangered if an ecosystemâ€™s delicate balance is disturbed. Thus, the occurrence of certain species and their numbers are often used as indicators of ecosystem health.

Lepilens for iOS is an application that uses the power of Deep Learning and Computer Vision to perform image classification. The Lepilens Deep learning model was built using Cloud Services generously provided through the Google Cloud research credits program. The model was trained using selected photos mostly collected from the iNaturalist Research-grade Observations dataset, published at GBIF by iNaturalist.

The ML model in Lepilens can identify more than 130 different species of butterflies that can be found in Portugal and around Europe. Lepilens iOS allows you to create new observations, delete them, keep a record and even export all your data so that you can keep a record of your expedictions.

A Web Version of Lepilens is also available [here](https://rubisco.duckdns.org/lepilens2/).
